What is CSS? | Fork CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to make it attractive. 
The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to web pages. 
More importantly, it enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
